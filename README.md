# TopDownShooter v0.01, build 005
Simple 2D shooter game in Unity.

Although the end-goal is build a "Gauntlet*" style, single player game, the main purpose is to build a game iterative fashion where at any point development can be abandoned for a period of time and then picked up later successfully. Too often my projects were build to a certain level of maturity and then 'something' happened which caused developement to stop (work required too much attention, vacations, no energy). When I got back to the project, the effort it would require to understand what was going on, what I was working on, what bugs existed were too big of a hurdle to pick up development again.    

To overcome this problem a lot more tracking of the state of the project is required, task lists, open bugs and so on. However the tracking should still be as minimal and as effective as possible to limit the 'drag' of the overhead.  

## Building the project
